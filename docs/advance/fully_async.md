# Recipe: Fully Async Policy Trainer

**Author:** `https://github.com/meituan-search`

Last updated: 10/18/2025.

This document introduces a fully asynchronous PPO training system that completely decouples the Trainer and Rollouter,
supporting asynchronous sample generation and training.
Under this system, we achieved a 2.35x-2.67x performance improvement when training the Qwen2.5-7B model with 128 GPUs,
without significantly affecting the results.

## Introduction

### Background

The separated rollout and train architecture, compared to the colocate architecture, can allocate resources more
flexibly and design more flexible training logic, thereby addressing issues such as low GPU utilization and training
efficiency caused by long-tail problems.
The one_step_off_policy alleviates the problem of long rollout times and achieves some gains in training efficiency by
designing a separated architecture and performing asynchronous training between rollout and train for one round.
However, it forcibly uses data from one round of asynchronous training, which is not flexible enough and cannot
completely eliminate the impact of long-tail on training efficiency.
In other frameworks such as AReaL, Magistral, StreamRL, and AsyncFlow, asynchronous training and streaming training have
been implemented based on the separated architecture and have achieved gains.
We borrow from their methods and implemented them in VERL. The fully_async_policy supports asynchronous, streaming, and partial
rollout training.
By reasonably setting parameters such as resource allocation and parameter synchronization frequency, fully_async_policy
can significantly improve training efficiency.

### Core Contributions

* **Resource Isolation**: Unlike using hybrid_engine, Rollouter and Trainer use separate computing resources and need to
  specify the resources they occupy separately.
* **Parallel Generation and Training**: While the Trainer is training, the Rollouter is generating new samples.
* **Multi-step Asynchronous**: Compared to one step off policy, it supports asynchronous settings from 0.x steps to
  multiple steps, making the asynchronous solution more flexible.
* **NCCL Parameter Synchronization**: Uses NCCL communication primitives for parameter communication between Rollouter
  and Trainer.
* **Stream Inference and Training**: Rollouter generates data sample by sample, and data transmission uses a single
  sample as the minimum transmission unit.
* **Asynchronous Training and Freshness Control**: By setting the parameter async_training.staleness_threshold, it
  supports training with samples generated by old parameters.
* **PartialRollout**: The Rollouter's inference process supports partial rollout logic. During parameter
  synchronization, by adding `sleep() and resume()` logic, it
  saves samples from ongoing rollouts and continues using them in the next rollout, reducing the time spent waiting for
  ongoing tasks to finish during parameter synchronization.

Currently, the supported usage mode is fsdp+vllm. vllm must use the server mode based on AgentLoop.

## Design

The overall architecture of fully_async_policy is shown in the figure below. fully_async_policy mainly consists of four
parts: Rollouter, MessageQueue, Trainer, and ParameterSynchronizer.

1. Rollouter generates sequences sample by sample and puts the generated samples into the MessageQueue, with the
   production speed controlled by freshness.
2. MessageQueue is used to temporarily store samples generated by Rollouter.
3. Trainer fetches samples from MessageQueue sample by sample. After fetching `require_batches*ppo_mini_batch_size`
   samples, it will perform training. After training for async_training.trigger_parameter_sync_step rounds, it triggers
   a parameter synchronization with Rollouter.
4. ParameterSynchronizer implements the NCCL synchronous parameter synchronization capability.

The source of benefits compared to the base scheme lies in the fact that in the colocate case, using more resources for
rollout cannot solve the idleness caused by long-tail samples.
After we perform resource isolation, the time for rollout and train may be longer than before (because fewer resources
are used),
but the overlap in their time consumption reduces the end-to-end time consumption.

**Further Explanation:**

* `rollout.total_rollout_steps`

  Compared to colocate, the quantity can be aligned by multiplying train_batch_size and step:
  `rollout.total_rollout_steps = data.train_batch_size * step`.

* `async_training.trigger_parameter_sync_step`

  In the fully async strategy, it indicates how many local updates the Trainer performs (i.e., how many times it fetches
  `require_batches * ppo_mini_batch_size` samples) before a parameter synchronization with Rollouter.
  Between every two parameter synchronizations between Rollouter and Trainer, the Trainer will process
  `trigger_parameter_sync_step* require_batches*ppo_mini_batch_size` samples.
  To fairly compare speed with colocate, trigger_parameter_sync_step should be set to
  `data.train_batch_size / (require_batches * ppo_mini_batch_size)`.

* `async_training.staleness_threshold`

  In the fully async strategy, it indicates the maximum proportion of stale samples allowed to be used.

    * staleness_threshold=0, indicates synchronous training.
      Rollouter will generate a fixed number of samples between two parameter updates, the sample count is:
      $$rollout\_num = (trigger\_parameter\_sync\_step*require\_batches*ppo\_mini\_batch\_size)$$
    * staleness_threshold>0, indicates asynchronous training, can be set to a decimal for more flexible asynchronous
      calls.
      Rollouter will generate at most the following number of samples between two parameter updates:
      $$rollout\_num = (1+staleness\_threshold)*(trigger\_parameter\_sync\_step*require\_batches*ppo\_mini\_batch\_size) - num\_staleness\_sample $$

  num_staleness_sample represents the number of stale samples generated in excess during the last rollout.

  Since it's a streaming system, rollout continues to generate and trainer continues to consume. If rollouter is slower,
  trainer will trigger parameter synchronization earlier, and rollouter will not actually produce rollout_num samples.
  When rollout is fast enough, setting staleness_threshold to 1 is basically equivalent to one_step_off policy.
  To avoid too many expired samples affecting training accuracy, it is recommended to set this value to less than 1.

* `async_training.partial_rollout`

  partial_rollout only actually takes effect when staleness_threshold>0.

* `async_training.use_rollout_log_probs`

  In reinforcement learning algorithms, log_probs have implicit correlations with parameter versions and tokens. Due to
  the settings of algorithms like PPO/GRPO/DAPO, when calculating importance sampling,
  old_log_prob must use the log_probs corresponding to the rollout parameters and tokens to ensure algorithm
  correctness. In the fully
  async strategy, we default to old_log_prob being calculated by rollout rather than by trainer.

    * `async_training.require_batches`

  In streaming training, require_batches should be set to 1, indicating that training is performed after producing
  enough ppo_mini_batch_size samples.
  In actual testing, we found that if fewer samples are issued at once, due to the order of data distribution, it can
  cause training instability and longer response lengths.
  Here, we additionally provide require_batches for streaming distribution and control the number of samples
  participating in training at once.

### Supported Modes

1. on policy pipeline:
    1. **trigger_parameter_sync_step=1, staleness_threshold=0**
    2. Rollouter produces `require_batches*ppo_mini_batch_size` samples at once, Trainer fetches these samples for
       training, and after training completes, Trainer and Rollouter perform a parameter synchronization;
    3. During the rollout phase, if there are long-tail samples but few rollout samples, shorter samples cannot fill
       idle resources, causing some resource waste.
    4. As shown in figure a;

2. stream off policy pipeline:
    1. **trigger_parameter_sync_step>1, staleness_threshold=0**
    2. Synchronous streaming training will be performed. Rollouter produces
       `require_batches*ppo_mini_batch_size*trigger_parameter_sync_step` samples at once, Trainer performs a local
       training every time it fetches `require_batches*ppo_mini_batch_size` samples, and after training
       trigger_parameter_sync_step times, Trainer and Rollouter perform a parameter synchronization;
    3. Compared to a, since more samples are generated at once, resource idleness will be lower.
    4. In one step training, there will be two periods of resource idleness: when fetching the first batch of samples,
       train waits for `require_batches*ppo_mini_batch_size` samples to be produced, and during the last parameter
       update, rollout waits for training to complete.
    5. As shown in figure b;

3. async stream pipeline with stale samples:
    1. **trigger_parameter_sync_step>=1, staleness_threshold>0, partial_rollout=False**
    2. After each parameter update, Rollouter will plan to produce at most rollout_num samples (in practice, the number
       of samples generated may be less than this value depending on rollout speed).
    3. If the rollout process is relatively fast, Rollouter will generate some additional samples num_stale_samples
       before parameter synchronization for immediate use by Trainer after synchronization.
       When triggering parameter synchronization, if Rollouter has ongoing tasks, it will wait for the tasks to complete
       and not add new tasks;
    4. Compared to b, except for the first step training, subsequent training will not have the time to wait for the
       first batch rollout to finish, but will have the time to wait for active tasks to finish.
    5. As shown in figure c;

4. async stream pipeline with partial rollout:
    1. **trigger_parameter_sync_step>=1, staleness_threshold>0, partial_rollout=True**
    2. Compared to c, when triggering parameter synchronization, if Rollouter has samples being produced, it will
       interrupt the rollout process and perform parameter synchronization. The interrupted samples will continue to be
       generated after synchronization. This reduces the time to wait for active tasks to finish.
    3. As shown in figure d;

### Parameter Tuning Recommendations

* Resource Allocation and Adjustment:
    * Reasonable resource allocation is the prerequisite for achieving good training efficiency. The ideal resource
      allocation should make the rollout time and train time close, thereby minimizing pipeline bubbles in the entire
      training process,
      avoiding resource idleness, and ensuring Trainer does not use old samples. In real training scenarios, resource
      allocation can be adjusted based on the idle time of rollout and train during actual training,
      which can be obtained from rollouter/idle_ratio and trainer/idle_ratio. If rollouter/idle_ratio is high and
      trainer/idle_ratio is low,
      Trainer resources should be increased and Rollouter resources should be reduced, and vice versa.

* Key Parameters:
    * staleness_threshold: Setting it too high will cause more old samples to be used, affecting model performance. It
      is recommended to set it to less than 1.
    * require_batches: The closer to 1, the closer to a pure streaming process, the smaller the training bubbles, and
      the faster the acceleration effect that can be achieved in terms of speed, but it will affect the order of sample
      processing;
    * trigger_parameter_sync_step: The smaller the setting, the closer to on policy, but it will cause frequent
      parameter synchronization. Long-tail samples waste resources that cannot be filled by short samples, resulting in
      low resource utilization.
      The larger the setting, the higher the computational efficiency, but the accuracy will be affected by off policy.
    * rollout.test_freq: It will occupy Rollouter resources and is not recommended to be set too small.

* Mode Selection: By adjusting different parameters, the Fully Async architecture supports optimization acceleration at
  different levels, suitable for tasks in different scenarios.
    * For small-scale tasks that need to ensure training stability and on-policy nature, and have low speed
      requirements, the on policy pipeline mode (Mode 1) can be tried.
    * For scenarios that need to improve training throughput but are sensitive to staleness, the stream off policy
      pipeline mode can be tried. That is, by
      setting trigger_parameter_sync_step>1 to improve training efficiency, but still maintaining the synchronization
      mechanism (staleness_threshold=0) (Mode 2).
    * For large-scale tasks with high training speed requirements and can tolerate a certain degree of off-policy and
      staleness, setting staleness_threshold>
      0 and partial_rollout=True can improve training efficiency, using the async stream pipeline mode (Mode 3 or 4).

### 128-card 7B Asynchronous Mode Experiment

We used Qwen2.5-Math-7B to verify the effects of various modes supported by fully async.
We can see that the benefit brought by streaming is approximately 0.6x, and after combining staleness and
partial_rollout, the benefit reaches 2.35x.

### 128-card Stale Ablation Experiment

Under the `async stream pipeline with partial rollout` mode, we verified the impact of staleness settings on training
efficiency.
We found that the larger the staleness, the more obvious the final gains.
We also noticed that the times for staleness values of 0.3 and 0.5 are quite close, because as the training steps
increase, the response length changes significantly, causing training instability.
Further analysis and optimization are needed for this issue.

### 128-card 7B require_batches Ablation Experiment

In multiple tests, we found that the number of samples issued each time in streaming affects the response length during
training, which in turn affects training time. We verified the impact on results by modifying
`async_training.require_batches`.
